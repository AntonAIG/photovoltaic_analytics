# Photovoltaic Systems Analytics
This repository contains all data analysis and machine learning learning tools that I have deployed in current and past projects to evaluate system performance of photovoltaic systems. It is an accummulation of various project and business investigations into photovoltaics that can be answered with data.

## NREL Photovoltaic Systems Analysis
[Link to the Notebook](https://github.com/AntonAIG/photovoltaic_analytics/blob/main/NREL_solar_systems/nrel_pv_analysis.ipynb)

The US National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL), in colaboration with the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) carried out an investigation of solar systems in the US.

The objective was to perform analysis for evaluating the performance of the solar systems on key metrices such as annual growth of system sizes and customer segmentation.

My role is to carryout this evaluation as outlined above and provide a summarized conclusion and recommendation for further actions. This is provided at the summary and recommendation section of this notebook.

In this project, we found out that:

There is a steady increase in the implementation of residential and non-residential systems along the years. This can also be seen from the increase in the number of projects, which means that more people are adopting PV as an alternitive means of geting power
The top 3 states in the non-residential customer segment makes up 72% of the projects while the top 3 states in the residential customer segment makes up 51%. This slighly shows the lesser attention paid towards non-residential development.
I would recommend that more non-residential projects should be developed in the future because of the potential for growth. They generally have higher capacity as seen in the image above, and this could translate to higher revenue and lower price/kWp generated.
